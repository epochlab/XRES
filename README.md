#### Single Image Super Resolution (SISR)
Abstract: *Single Image Super Resolution aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image for a low-resolution (LR) observation.*

### Dataset
- [Vimeo-90K](http://toflow.csail.mit.edu/index.html#septuplet): Large-scale, high-quality dataset, consisting of 89,800 clips from vimeo.com.<br />
- [Flickr-Faces-HQ](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset): High-quality image dataset of 70,000 human faces, created as a benchmark for generative adversarial networks.<br />
- [CelebFacesA](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html): A large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200k celebrity, each with 40 annotations.

### Packages

`tensorflow-2.x` `numpy` `pillow`

### Requirements
- Both Linux and Windows are supported. Linux is recommended for performance and compatibility reasons.
- 64-bit Python 3.7.9 installation.
